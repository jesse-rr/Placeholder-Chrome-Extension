# Placeholder-chrome-extension

A simple chrome extension to hold/add/remove information. Created by me just because if I wanted to search/save a link for something later I would not forget, also used to keep my github key in case I needed to do more than one pull/clone of a repo. It's free use, just go right ahead and clone it, remove the README.sh, alter the code & or delete it, don't care, it's just a simple extension after all.

```sh
chrome://extension           (ON SEARCHBAR)

Finish by adding the directory and done! :D
